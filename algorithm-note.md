algorithm

        used to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problems-
    solving suitable for implementation as a computer program.
        Performance is a central consideration in algorithm.

data-structure

        schemas for organizing data that leave them amenable to efficient
    processing by an algorithm.

ADTs

        abstract data types.
        we consider 2 fundamental ADTs: bags, queue, stack

API

        applications programming interface
